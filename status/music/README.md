## Jamming Stats

Sometimes I play drums for fun. This document will track my progress.

It should also make the "what to play together" challenge more manageable when jamming with other people.

I can play both acoustic and electronic drums.

### Songs Played

This list does not represent my musical taste. I don't mind playing pretty much anything as long as I can handle it.

Levels:

* 0/3 - can't play it yet, but it's on my radar and I'm practicing it
* 1/3 - can play on a basic level, without fills/intros, etc.
* 2/3 - can play with some level of confidence
* 3/3 - considering this track to be mastered (should be aligned with my skill level cap)

> I may split this table later when (and if) it gets bigger.

| Title | Level |
|---|---|
| Survivor - Eye of the Tiger | 3 |
| Bob Dylan - Knocking On Heaven's Door | 2 |
| Gorillaz - Feel Good Inc | 1 |
| Green Day - Boulevard of Broken Dreams | 1 |
| Placebo - Twenty Years | 1 |
| Brad Sucks - Bad Attraction | 0 |
| Blur - song 2 | 0 |
