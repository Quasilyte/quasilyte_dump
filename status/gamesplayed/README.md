## Games Played

### [itch.io](https://itch.io/) indie games

Sometimes I [play random games](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAjl-3QkinHsHaEnaie_FFG1sI8KU2Eoq) from [itch.io](https://itch.io/). I wonder, how many games from this list you ever heard of.

| Game | Short summary |
|---|---|
| [Mandrake](https://osakitsukiko.itch.io/mandrake) | A turn-based RPG game with a very simple combat mechanics and counter-intuitive character progression. The artstyle is great. |
| [Samoai](https://reyoruga.itch.io/samoai) | A 2D fighting platformer; it's not a finished game, but it can be entertaining for 30 minutes or so. |
| [Nebula Mining Corp](https://lightningspell.itch.io/nebula-mining-corp) | A game with a font that is very hard to read. The game itself lacks difficulty progression. The graphics are good. |
| [Soul of Forest](https://blayz-by-fill.itch.io/soul-of-the-forest) | A very simple 2D platformer focused around jumping puzzles. |
| [Striving For Light: Survival](https://ignitingsparkgames.itch.io/strivingforlight-survival) | A well-made survival-style game, but its graphical style is not my cup of tea. |
| [Astra Defender](https://yokereba.itch.io/astra-defender) | An interesting top-down shooter combined with an RTS. Try it out. |
| [Verdant](https://justinmullin.itch.io/verdant) | A good tower defense game; it's a very solid game jam entry, it feels quite polished too. |
| [Huck and Hubble](https://chefpancake.itch.io/hucknhubble) | A well-drawn game with OK concepts, but the execution is quite annoying. This game is hard to navigate, the terrain is sticky. |
| [Love At First Sight](https://mrmathur.itch.io/love-at-first-sight) | A very simple and short game focused around "don't look here" mechanic. |
| [FiBunnyCci into the Yilon-Verse](https://piccoloplay.itch.io/fibunnycci-into-the-yilon-verse) | This game is weird, but maybe for its own good. The author put a lot of efforts to create things around the game, like wikis, etc. |
| [Graveyard Shift](https://badcop.itch.io/graveyard-shift) | Now this is a good stuff. A nice card puzzle game with great presentation. |
| [Elephant In The Room](https://epicramen3d.itch.io/elephantintheroom) | A Hotline Miami-like game. It could be better if collision boxes were more precise; the instant shooting reaction is weird too. |
| [Golden Warden](https://xpii.itch.io/golden-warden) | A nice game that plays like a turn-based combat game. It's not unique, but it's still refreshing enough. |
| [KittInn](https://pastel-cherry-games.itch.io/kittinn) | This game is too buggy to be described, but the idea is that you're running a kitty hotel. It's an OK start. |
| [Weak Sbot](https://blek.itch.io/weak-sbot) | A game where you fight several bosses. It's interesting and good-looking, but the difficulty balance might be slightly off. |
| [Cliche Hunter](https://njitram.itch.io/cliche-hunter) | Another game from a Cliche-themed game jam. It's a game full of gags. Gameplay-wise, it's mostly a 2D platformer game. |
| [Blasteroids](https://kharibidus.itch.io/blasteroids) | Remember a classic Asteroids game? Well, in this game, you play as asteroids; you destroy spaceships. |
| [Shoot Into The Void](https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/shoot-into-the-void) | A game where you have to memorize your target locations and then direct a projectile through the darkness to get them. |
| [Escort Mission](https://sinisterstuf.itch.io/escort-mission) | A top-down shooter build around the "escort mission" cliche concept. It's good for a single run. |
| [It's But a Scratch](https://blazingedgegames.itch.io/tis-but-a-scratch) | A well-styled top-down shooter game, if a bit too easy. The sound design is great. |
| [You Catch My Drift?](https://beanfox.itch.io/you-catch-my-drift) | A simple rally-style racing game with a split-screen support. I played a couple of races with my friend. |
| [Space Survivors](https://roaming-maelstrom.itch.io/space-survivors) | Like a Vampire Survivors, but with space vessels. It's OK. |
| [Uphill Battle](https://jaredn.itch.io/uphill-battle) | A card battling game. It's quite nice for a game jam submission. |
| [In the Bag](https://sandramoen.itch.io/in-the-bag) | I can actually recommend this game. It could use some post-jam polish to become a good game, it has the potential. |
| [It's not a bug it's a feature](https://partyvaper.itch.io/its-not-a-bug-its-a-feature) | A game that required me to go through its sources as a gameplay mechanic. The graphics are neat too. |
| [Curious Cats](https://e-potapova.itch.io/curious-cats) | It's like Lemmings, but with cats. It's good for a jam game. |
| [Space Defenders](https://irywo.itch.io/space-defenders) | Probably one of the most simplistic games I played on the record. But hey, it's a game jam submission. |
| [Specter X-terminators](https://kblm-studio.itch.io/specter-x-terminators) | A game inspired by Undertale. The execution is good (for a jam prototype), but the game is really-really short. |
| [Zero Zero UFO](https://kronoman.itch.io/zero-zero-ufo) | A cool (but silent) retro arcade made for DOS! I played this game on Linux using DosBox software. |
| [Glass Jungle](https://polanski.itch.io/glass-jungle) | A cheesy shooter made for a "Cliche" game jam. It's full of cliches. |
| [Geometry Battles](https://hyperstellar-games.itch.io/geometry-battles) | A well-made RTS game with minimalistic graphics. The AI could be better though. |
| [Danmaku](https://zergon321.itch.io/touhou-game-in-go) | A Touhou-inspired bullet hell game. |
| [Violet's Awakening](https://rafaskb.itch.io/violets-awakening) | A game that reminds me of TUNIC, but it's quite broken and unfinished. |
| [Fairyside](https://kiyummi.itch.io/fairyside) | Plays like a cute and lighter version of Binding of Isaac. |
