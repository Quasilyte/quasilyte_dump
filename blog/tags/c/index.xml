      <title>Path to convenient C FFI in Go</title>

      <description>DWIM-style FFI CGo is a widely adopted way of calling C functions from Go: low level C FFI which does many things behind the scene, but exposes only minimal functionality that is required to interact with C.
CGo does no implicit conversions or data copying during C functions call, even int and C.int are not compatible. Code that uses this mechanism without wrappers (bindings) will be polluted with explicit slice/array copies and type conversions.</description>

      <description>State of the C C fits its niche quite well. If you want relatively simple, ubiquitous and efficient language there is no much room for selection.
It &amp;ldquo;evolves so slowly&amp;rdquo; because it is already quite complete. Most of the parts that can be improved without making C yet another bloated language require breaking changes.
 C could be designed better if we accept older code invalidation.
 &amp;hellip;but in reallity it is impossible to achieve.</description>
