      <description>Original (ru): https://habr.com/post/481696/.
 gogrep is one of my favorite tools. It gives you the ability to search Go code using syntax patterns, filter matches by expression types, and perform structural replace.
Today I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how to use gogrep and about VS Code extension that integrates gogrep into the editor.
Why do you need gogrep? In a nutshell, gogrep is useful for:
 Refactoring (search and replace) Codebase exploration Suspicious code detection (example: ruleguard)  I&amp;rsquo;ll show you an example that demonstrates the power and elegance of the structural search.</description>

      <description>Agenda This article shows how to add a new instruction to RISC-V and simulate it.
These topics are covered along the way:
 Whole GNU riscv toolchain installation; Implementation of a new instruction for spike RISC-V ISA simulator; Manual instruction encoding in C/C++; Custom instruction simulation (with visible output); [riscv32-]GCC plugin development;  You may find associated repository useful.
Many things can go wrong. Be prepared to fix upcoming issues by yourself.</description>
